00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:14.852
Daughter, it's time for us to go to your dentist appointment.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.856
Stay calm, daughter.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.277
She'll just look inside your mouth and see how your teeth are.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.945
Today I'm going to visit my dentist

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:31.800
It's very important for me to go there

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.953
The mouth I'll open and

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:37.996
she will look.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:43.384
To see if everything is clean and then strong it will be.

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:44.426
Hi

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:45.746
We arrived.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:48.429
Hello, I'll let you know when it's your turn.

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:53.137
I wait in the small room in front of the door.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.664
I joke until she calls my name.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.036
The coat hang

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:03.463
A drawing I'm going to paint

00:01:03.904 --> 00:01:08.376
Or maybe the TV look Or a play game

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.894
The dentist will see you now.

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:13.418
They can pass.

00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:17.989
When it's my turn to get in there

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.521
I climb on this chair so cool

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.096
Above are the lights,

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:28.462
It's very interesting.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.736
She presses a button

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.055
and the chair then rises.

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:43.266
And she then takes some pictures

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.718
With your x-ray machine

00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.977
I stand there quietly,

00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:53.462
Without touching anything

00:01:53.923 --> 00:01:56.269
The picture shows my teeth and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.296
Wow, very cool

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.655
That's right, the x-ray is great.

00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:07.043
Now I'm going to clean your teeth, they'll be shiny.

00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:13.074
The dentist sees if everything is in order.

00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:18.026
She looks to see if my teeth are strong.

00:02:18.824 --> 00:02:20.889
And then it starts cleaning.

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:23.372
Weird will sweat.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:28.360
And after she's done, I can rinse my mouth.

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.020
It shows how I should brush.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.030
Always when getting up and going to bed.

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:45.883
The teeth will stay

00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:48.348
white and shine.

00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:53.336
If I take strong care of my teeth, they will stay.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.639
That's it, that's it.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.304
It wasn't a big deal, was it?

00:02:57.842 --> 00:02:58.223
No.

00:02:58.566 --> 00:02:59.068
Cool.

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:01.508
Now I'm going to give you a new brush.

00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:03.252
What is your favorite color?

00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:04.014
Purple.

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:04.794
OK.

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:09.644
Here's a purple brush and a sticker for being such a good patient.

00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:15.681
Today I visited my dentist

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:19.192
It was very important for me to go there

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.354
I opened my mouth

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:25.901
And she looked there

00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:31.078
and saw that everything was fine, I will come back again.
